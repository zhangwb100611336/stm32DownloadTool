The code design of hex

Purpose
    This document is mainly describle the detail design and function of the hex.c.

Hex file
    Firstly,we should knows what is a hex file.
    Hex file is a file format,and it consists of many special lines.
    The format of each lines as following describle.
    uint:byte
    ****************************************************************************************
    * |start code ':'(1) | byte count (1)| address(2) | record type(1)| data | checksum(1)|*
    ****************************************************************************************

    if you want know more detail about the six fields , please refs folloing link, and no more
    introduce here.if you are not in china , you can search more useful infomation in google.

Function
    OK, this should be the mainly part in this document.
    below is the expected function what i need:
    1) it can read data form the hex file and storage the data relate real address only.
    2) the storaged data can be read.
    3) the storaged data can be print for debug.
    4) it should be object-oriented design


    1、hex file read
        input: file name
        output: file instance id

        step1: get file fd
        step2: read data and storage in list
        step3: record list

    1.1 read data & storage
        input: file fd
        output: list address which storage data from hex file

        record data in list line by line until end.


    2、read data form list
        input: file name / file  instance id
        output: line header address
